## What is Data packing?
Data packing in Hugging Face with PyTorch involves concatenating multiple shorter sequences into a longer sequence to maximize the utilization of the input context length, especially in transformer-based models. This technique aims to improve training efficiency by reducing padding and processing more data within each batch.

## General overview of Implementation aspect?
The procedure of general way of implementing Data Packing for all types of models as follwos (There will be differences between different familiy of LLMs like Transformers based and Mamba based ones)
- *Tokenization and Concatenation:* Tokenize multiple sequences and concatenate them.
- *Masking:* Adjusting masks to prevent attention across sequence boundaries within the packed sequence.
- *Position IDs:* Reset or adjust position IDs for each sequence within the packed sequence to ensure correct positional encoding.

Here is an example of how it should be applied on input sequences:
`
Sequence 1: "The cat sat"
Sequence 2: "on the mat."
